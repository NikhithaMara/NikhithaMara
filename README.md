## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nikhitha Mara, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Information Systems at the University of Texas at Arlington. I have over 5 years of experience as an Application Developer at IBM, specializing in SAP ABAP for the Volkswagen client.

As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect, Iâ€™m transitioning into DevOps and Cloud Engineering because Iâ€™m excited by the power of automation and cloud tech to speed up software delivery and simplify infrastructure..

ðŸŒ± I recently earned my AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification, which strengthened my knowledge of key AWS services including EC2, EBS, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, Serverless Architecture, ECS, CloudFormation (Infrastructure as Code), High Availability, Scalability, Application and Network Load Balancers, Cost Optimization, Security, IAM, Cognito, and SageMaker.
