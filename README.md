## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nikhitha Mara, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Information Systems at the University of Texas at Arlington. I have over 5 years of experience as an Application Developer, specializing in SAP ABAP for the Volkswagen client.

I have transitioned into cloud computing and data science, with a passion for building scalable cloud-based solutions and extracting insights from data. I am skilled in AWS architecture and Python-based data analytics, enjoying the blend of these disciplines to solve real-world challenges. As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect, I am actively seeking opportunities in Cloud Engineering, Solutions Architecture, and Data Analyticsâ€”where I can bridge cloud infrastructure with intelligent, data-driven decision-making.

ðŸ”­ Currently, Iâ€™m working on a To-Do List application that follows AWS best architectural practices.

ðŸŒ± I recently earned my AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification, which strengthened my knowledge of key AWS services including EC2, EBS, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, Serverless Architecture, ECS, CloudFormation (Infrastructure as Code), High Availability, Scalability, Application and Network Load Balancers, Cost Optimization, Security, IAM, Cognito, and SageMaker.
